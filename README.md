# Students-Career-Prediction 

Competition in today’s society is heavily multiplying day by day. It is too heavy in the present day’s technical world. So as to compete and reach the goal students need to be planned and organized from the initial stages of their education. So it is very important to constantly evaluate their performance, identify their interests and evaluate how close they are to their goal, and assess whether they are on the right path that directs toward their target. This helps them in improving themselves, motivating themselves to a better career path if their capabilities are not up to the mark to reach their goal, and pre-evaluate themselves before going to the career peak point.
